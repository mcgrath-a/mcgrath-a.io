    <h1>My First Blog Post: Aly's Growing Up</h1>
<h2>A teen no longer</h2>

<p>
  If you are reading this, that means I've decided to put pen to paper and write my thoughts; I am glad you're here. Please be warned this 
  blog is not anything formal; in fact, please treat it as a conversation between you and me. In the following few paragraphs, you'll find some 
  updates on my life, things many of you know or might not have known, a progress report on how things are going, and some really exciting news. 
  I titled this blog post 'Aly's Growing Up' to commemorate my last few weeks/days (depending on when you're reading this), being 19, come November 25, 2022, 
  I won't be a teen ever again. Not to be dramatic or anything, but damn, where did the time go? Anyway, I hope you enjoy reading and catching up with me.

<h2>College Life</h2>
 <p>
  As you all know, I am attending Occidental College in Los Angeles, California. I am currently a sophomore 
  in my 3rd semester (about to start the 4th in a few months). Ever since I committed to this school, I think I've been asked the same question/plus 
  or minus a couple words: "Oh wow, that's so far from home," or "Wow, you're gonna be far away" "Are you excited to be on the other side of the country?", 
  "Do you think you'll like it ?". The list goes on and on, and I get it people are curious; that's typical human nature, but being that I am a sophomore now, I can answer this question with more experience. I love it here; the distance is not an issue, especially when I call my mom at least 3 times a day (sometimes more). Yay, some days are harder than others, especially when it comes to 6 am practice and then 3 classes in a row, but that's college life. I signed up for this, 
  and in about two years and change, I'll have a degree to show for it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here at Oxy, which we call Occidental for short, all first-year students come in as undecided and not pressured to choose a path right away, meaning we only declare a major later in our sophomore year. Well, as you know, I'm unique and already knew what path I wanted to take before I was required to choose one. I officially declared as a computer science major last year in the spring semester of my first year.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before you compliment me on my intelligence to pick such a complex major, trust me, I know, and all I can say is that while I do love it, I love problem-solving and learning new technologies and programming languages; I must say this is not for the weak. As I start taking upper-division courses, I know it will only get more demanding, but I am prepared and well-equipped to handle those challenges. If there's one thing about me, you know I love challenging myself. I mean, heck, I was on the Dean's List twice for the fall and spring semesters with a 4.0 GPA, and I am on track to do that again this year. The only person stopping me is me.

<h2>Basketball</h2>
<p>OK! I'm excited to get started. The <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/#quick-start">Eleventy quick start guide</a> suggests that installation is a 3-line process. Sounds great to me! So I clone <a href="https://github.com/andrewborstein/portfolio">my portfolio repo</a> locally, open the directory in my text editor and attempt step 1, which looks like installing the Eleventy node module globally:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ npm install -g @11ty/eleventy
</code></pre>
<h2>Just kidding, everything is broken. Debugging time.</h2>

</code></pre>
<p>I'm faced with my first quandary. This is exactly the kind of nonsense I was hoping to avoid. Do I dive in and fix solve this or reach for another tool? Is this a harbinger of what's to come? Perhaps it's future me, warning of the dangers that lie ahead.</p>
<p>Well, no use dwelling on it. Good developers solve problems. I'd like to be a good developer. But good developers also sidestep problems that don't need solving... The best, most resilient, future-proof code is the code you never write. Still, the whole point of this exercise is putting in the work now so I can make blogging easier later. I guess we're gonna dive in...</p>
<h2>Installing Node on a second mac user account</h2>
<p>I googled the above error and it looks like I may have a quick resolution (<a href="https://flaviocopes.com/npm-fix-missing-write-access-error/">Thanks, Flavio!</a>). OK, actually that leads was a red herring. Following the steps outlined in the post didn't fix the error. There's a note in there that sticks out to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This tip applies to single user systems. On a multi-user system, you might want to create a dedicated directory for npm modules, see <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally">https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had a hunch this was related to being a multi-user system. I installed a separate user account on my work laptop for all of my non-work projects, and that's where I'm working now. I haven't gotten very deep into personal projects on this laptop. It's my work work horse (puns!), and I probably wouldn't have encountered this issue at all had I been working on my primary user account. But now I want to fix it, and that NPM has some advice for me in the article Flavio linked to.</p>
<h2>Installing a Node version manager (NVM)</h2>
<p>OK, super, I'm off to install a Node version manager so that I can easily install, well, any version of Node. Or install multiple versions of node and toggle between them on different projects, all from a few simple Terminal commands.</p>
<p>OH, wow, I was literally looking at this <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm">NVM documentation</a> two weeks ago! I spent a few hours trying to install it for work only to realize one of my local bash aliases was overwriting a command included in the NVM the install script. I was annoyed then, but it makes sense that the docs don't mention anything about the error I'm seeing — I might be the only person to ever encounter it, because of my very specific setup.</p>
<p>When I run step 1 of their install instructions, this is what I see:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100 13527  100 13527    0     0  71286      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 71194
(23) Failed writing body
</code></pre>
<p>Whaddya know I get the same error now that I did the first time! Luckily this one is fresh in my mind. Apparently <code>.bash_profile</code> files don't automatically sync between different mac user accounts, otherwise the fix I found 2 weeks ago would be present here, too.</p>
<p>I still have a <a href="https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-create-bash-aliases/">bash alias</a> called <code>bash</code> (maybe you can already imagine why that's a terrible name), which clearly needs to change as it's competing with the <code>bash</code> command in the NVM install script. We've both defined a command with the name <code>bash</code>, but the NVM script can only reference one of them. In this case, it will call either the first or last one defined. I want their script to win, though, so I change my script from</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Open the bash profile, e.g. $ bash
alias bash='open ~/.bash_profile'
</code></pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Open the bash profile, e.g. $ open_bash
alias open_bash='open ~/.bash_profile'
</code></pre>
<p>This is one of the fun (torturous?) parts about being a web developer. Bugs happen. They are 1000% unavoidable. The systems we were work in are not closed, or static — they are ever-evolving with more and more interdependencies. And more and more flawed humans working in them. You can't predict every edge case, like the dummy at home that happens to make a bash alias called, ahem, <code>bash</code>. But you can at least do your part to share your hard earned knowledge with other <s>dummies</s> folks that might encounter the same problem.</p>
<p>After changing the name of my alias, the NVM installation command failed one more time, just for fun-sies, so I restarted my Terminal and <em>phew</em> it ran fine.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash
# ... successful installation 🎉

$ command -v nvm
nvm
</code></pre>
<p>The above means that my computer knows how to respond to a command named <code>nvm</code> . In other words, nvm works now. Thank jeebus.</p>
<h2>Installing a specific version of Node with NVM</h2>
<p>Looks like I've got one more step here, which is installing a version of Node using my handy dandy new version manager. I opt for the latest version, which is the default, since I have no reason to believe I need a specific, older version to work with Eleventy.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ nvm install node
Downloading and installing node v14.0.0...

</code></pre>
<p>Whew! Node is officially installed, which I verify just to be safe.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ node -v
v14.0.0
</code></pre>
<h2>Final thoughts: ¯\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯</h2>
<p>What an epic detour the start of a my blogging project. Aside from getting some hopefully useful content for this post, I didn't get to work on a single piece of the actual blog infrastructure. Even the best-laid plans sometimes go wrong. And in web development we can comfortably swap &quot;sometimes&quot; with &quot;always.&quot;</p>
<p>During this process I am <em>constantly</em> reminded about the fragility of what I'm building. What if I want to leave this site alone and revisit in a year, and the latest stable and secure version of Node is now v15 instead of v14? Will everything be broken? Will there be urgent security vulnerabilities? What sort of Herculean effort will be required just to work on my simple blog site if I <em>gasp</em> get a new laptop?? For now, I'm filing those away as &quot;future me&quot; problems. Experimentation! Learning! <code>wind.push(caution)</code>. Ugh, that's corny.</p>
<p>Ok back to the main event, Eleventy. What could go wrong? I'm as curious as you are. Come back sometime in the nearish future (hopefully next week) — for Part 2 of this series — to find out.</p>
